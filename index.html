<b>Goal:</b> Be the first to get three pairs of cards, where each pair totals 10.
<br>Ace is taken as 1. In the case of 10, J, Q and K, you have to get a pair of that card, for example, two Jacks make a pair.
Examples of pairs include: A and 9, 7 and 3, K and K, 10 and 10. 
<br><b>How to proceed:</b>
You start off with 6 cards. Discard a card to start the game. 
At each turn, you either take the top card from the discard pile,
or draw a card from the well. If you do not have 3 pairs of cards, 
you will have to discard a card to end your turn. Both you and the computer
will do the same until either of you ends up with 3 pairs of cards.
<br><b>Tip:</b>
Try not to discard a card you suspect the computer wants.</div>
